### Installation

The recommended approach to use _Cocarde_ in your project is using the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager, as it provides flexible dependency management and dead simple installation.

#### CocoaPods

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```
Go to the directory of your Xcode project, and Create and Edit your Podfile and add _QRCodeReade.swift_:

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/MyProject
$ touch Podfile
$ edit Podfile
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
pod 'Cocarde', '~> 1.0.0'
```

Install into your project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

Open your project in Xcode from the .xcworkspace file (not the usual project file)

``` bash
$ open MyProject.xcworkspace
```

#### Manually

[Download](https://github.com/YannickL/Cocarde/archive/master.zip) the project and copy the `Cocarde` folder into your project to use it in.
